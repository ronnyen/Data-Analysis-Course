UCTV0CAq7RoWSZSCXQ-4CCag,,"Sigrid is the popstar you’ve been searching for. She might be from a small town in Norway, but she has a mind, attitude and voice bigger than any other 20-year-old.

I’m With Her is Sara Watkins, Sarah Jarosz and Aoife O’Donovan. Since 2015, the trio has toured the world together and formed a special, family-like chemistry, garnering acclaim for their unique blend of instrumental interplay combined with their indelible harmonies, as the New York Times describes, “... that could be sweetly ethereal, or as tightly in tandem as country sibling teams like the Everly Brothers, or as hearty as mountain gospel.” Their debut album, See You Around, was recorded in Bath, England, with Ethan Johns at Real World Studios.

UCfLdIEPs1tYj4ieEdJnyNyw,US,"23-year-old independent singer, songwriter, and producer Lauv resembles an auteur in his assemblage of electronic tones, airy beats, jazz-inspired guitars, and soulful vocalizations. After logging countless hours in his bedroom writing and producing, Lauv entered the prestigious Music Technology Program at NYU in 2012. Under the auspices that he’d “make music for other artists,” he passionately maintained a prolific output until penning “The Other” during 2014. “The Other” quietly took the internet by storm. Premiered on a friend’s blog as his first release under the name Lauv, the song virally lit up HypeMachine and eventually generated 100 million-plus Spotify streams.

Relocating to Los Angeles and signing a publishing deal with Prescription Songs, he co-wrote the gold-certified Top 5 smash “No Promises” by Cheat Codes and Demi Lovato as well as the Pitchfork-endorsed “Boys” for Charli XCX, among others. In the meantime, “I Like Me Better” became his second bona fide smash.",Lauv,2015-03-10T08:39:42.000Z,https://yt3.ggpht.com/--UX6FxSBr50/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/aUuIWd2Stog/s88-c-k-no-mo-rj-c0xffffff/photo.jpg,0,414337,30,99073536,"['/m/04rlf', '/m/064t9', '/m/04rlf', '/m/064t9']"

Imagine a cross between MacGyver, James Bond, and the Myth-busters.  A world of Sciencey Guy Stuff!  ..where girls can play too.

“Don’t try this at home” is something we hear all the time.  The King of Random asks why not?  What exactly are the risks??  Then figures out ways to approach these risks safely and in a controlled environment, conducting experiments to verify exactly what happens.  There is excitement found in discovering the unknown, and living to tell about it.

But since I was elected to office I've learned first hand that even a single person can actually make a big difference if they choose to. I want people to see what politics is like on the inside, and how people really do have the power to change things if they pay attention and learn which political levers to pull to make things happen.

Today I serve as a State Representative in the Hawaii State Legislature. I've been fortunate to have helped lead the fight to successfully pass laws making Hawaii a national leader on renewable energy, climate change, equal rights, and building a fair and just 21st century economy that leaves no one behind. Now I'm working to engage more people, especially our next generation, to get involved and help change politics to build a better future for us all.",Chris Lee,2011-10-03T19:55:50.000Z,https://yt3.ggpht.com/-ZI4eIbL9V8Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/11Z0nhjZzfg/s88-c-k-no-mo-rj-c0xffffff/photo.jpg,0,7643,10,430714,"['/m/098wr', '/m/098wr', '/m/05qt0']"

I strongly believe that the Artists, Creative Person, and Dreamers of the world deserve more respect than they are given. 

I believe that anyone CAN be a successful person or own a creative business that awards you with the freedom to live your life on your own terms. Make your own way to live your life as YOU desire, rather than having your life commanded by others.

I am sure you will agree with me that success is not defined by how many degrees you hold, what people think about you or much more. 

The only things define your success is You. Success does not come and find you.You have to go out and get it.

After an endless stream of doctors and tests, Ellie was finally diagnosed with a type of infertility called PCOS.  Fertility treatments and more disappointments followed until finally we got pregnant.  We were blessed with a wonderful, healthy baby boy who is now a very active toddler. Then, suddenly, without the help of any fertility treatments we were blessed with another amazing baby boy.  We are now enjoying our family adventures and we are excited to share them with you daily!

We are living proof that dreams come true  Our channel is about our family including our miracle babies Jackson and Calvin and their growing up adventures.  We hope our enthusiasm for life and our positive energy is contagious. Join us for new, family friendly videos every day.

Answers to some common questions:

1) I studied Mechanical Engineering in School.  I did my undergrad at BYU and Masters at USC.
2) I worked for NASA JPL for 9 years, 7 of which were working on the Curiosity Rover (I made a video about it you should def totes watch cause it's probably my favorite of all my videos).  I founded a company called Digital Dudz on my nights and weekends while working at NASA (also made some videos about that) and sold it to the guys who make Morphsuits in the UK.  As part of the sale I quit my job at NASA and worked for them coming up with all their new costume ideas for 2 years.  Recently, I was presented with an opportunity to return to my Engineering roots to come do some ideation type of work for a tech company near San Francisco.

So far, I've eaten and filmed street food and local cuisine in China, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. Eating the same food as local Chinese, Malaysian, or Thai people has showed me that it's best to travel almost solely for the food! My dream is to keep eating and traveling the world forever, a non-stop adventure!  I live to travel, and I know you do too! I love eating street foods and culinary treats while learning about new cultures!

I also like to teach and inspire people and believe that anyone can make anything.

The goal of this channel is to educate and inspire the electronics ProMaker, Maker, or someone starting.
Whether you're into STEM, ""Internet of Things"", makerspaces, Maker Faires, quick tutorials, projects or just an honest review on a Maker product then this channel is for you.

New videos uploaded every week.
Hope you find this channel both entertaining and informational.

UCOkWMIcLDDV1P48NSCdkJ5w,,"Born in 1999, Asthmatic Kitty Records was originally conceived as a platform for musical projects by a community of artists from Holland, Michigan, a small city on the shore of Lake Michigan. Some were Holland natives, and others had come to attend local colleges and universities. While the original Holland nucleus has now dispersed to various parts of the country, the fellowship is still growing, with new friends and shared projects with other independent labels. Asthmatic Kitty is now based in Lander, Wyoming, Indianapolis, Indiana and New York City.

Asthmatic Kitty was named after Sara, a voluptuous orange and white longhair who wandered out of the woods in 1995, pregnant, starving, and afflicted with various parasites and ailments, including feline asthma. Although she still wheezes a bit, especially when being chased by her sister Tabby, Sara today enjoys a healthy and happy life of luxury.

But really it's a community built on support, learning, interaction, and a love of filmmaking.

Tutorials, tips and tricks, interviews, podcasts, live streams, events, contests, forums, film commentary, and behind the scenes. New content every week, at every level, from beginning to advanced.

RocketJump Film School is for everyone, regardless of your level of experience, the type of gear you have, or where you're at in life. There will be something for everyone, and as we go forward with this school, it is the filmmakers and community using RJFS that will shape it into what it will ultimately become.

Q: Are you a furry?
A: No

Q: Gender/Pronouns?
A: Female. She/her.

Q: How do you animate?
A: Fun fact: I don't use any animation programs. I draw all my frames in clip studio paint then edit them together on premiere pro.

Q: Equipment/software?
A: To record, I use a blue yeti mic, record in audacity, level the audio in levelator, then edit the audio in premiere pro. I draw with a Huion G-221 Pro and a Surface Pro 4.

Q: Can we collab?
A: Keep in mind I get the question probably like a hundred times a day and I have bad anxiety, so I might not be able to, but I've collabed with people before. Hmu on twitter or email or something.

Q: How do you start a YouTube channel?

THE MUSIC OF A MOVEMENT

At Reach, our passion is changing the way people see the world. The reason we create music and media, and travel the world to hit stages big and small is not simply to be successful. Our goal has always been the hearts of the people.

Our hope lies in the person and work of Jesus. If this man was a mere teacher our work would be influenced by him. Yet he claims to be God and change the hearts of humanity. That is the message we bring. Everyone is preaching something, whether it's the gospel of money, power and sex, or even education and the American dream.  We aim to serve through art, to bring healing and show others a different way to view their world.

The heartbeat of Reach is Romans 1:16 ""For I am not ashamed of the gospel for is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes.""

Are you Unashamed?  Join the movement.",Reach Records,2006-07-17T15:38:21.000Z,https://yt3.ggpht.com/-zB6lFWexYJc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/1AASeq1Mrko/s88-c-k-no-mo-rj-c0xffffff/photo.jpg,1502,550357,814,334943548,"['/m/04rlf', '/m/0glt670', '/m/04rlf', '/m/0glt670']"

Since 2008 I have been developing machines that self-balance with the wrong number of wheels and my current favourite to ride by far is the one wheel electric motorbike. Pretty dangerous, few or no safety features!
I have been making things since I was a child but as an adult my toys are now bigger so we also have old cars; Mexican Beetle, Aussie VE Valiant (an Australian Dodge Dart for US viewers), plus a few electronic and assisted living gadgets.
The one-wheeler is a never ending development and testing process, so look out for updates featuring the failures and the successes.

Co-written by The Vamps with DJ Frank E (Madonna, Jason Derulo), John Mitchell (Enter Shikari) and Danny Magic (David Guetta), All Night glistens with future-facing beats and a juggernaut melody at its heart. Since they burst onto the scene in 2013 – debuting with Top 3 hits (Can We Dance, Wild Heart, Last Night) – the four talented young musicians have barely stopped. Their debut album, 2014’s Meet The Vamps, was a smash, followed 18 months later by their second album, Wake Up. Within those first two years, the band had sold out London’s 20,000 capacity O2 four times, with multiple world tours visiting over 25 countries.  The Vamps following continues to grow rapidly – their YouTube channel has just topped 379M views and combined with their VEVO channel, they are quickly approaching 1Ž2 Billion views and 2.7M subscribers.

A.This is in Far North Queensland Australia.
Q.Do you live in the wild?
A.I don't live in the wild but just go into the bush to make these projects. Also I camp out here occasionally.
Q.How did you learn all this?
A.Researching books and internet plus trial and error. I'm not indigenous and have no army training.
Q.What about dangerous animals in Australia?
A.The only really dangerous ones in my area are snakes. Care must be taken when walking about and lifting things from the ground.
Q.For the mud huts what stops the rain washing the mud walls away?
A.The roof.

I'll be sharing some of the things that I get up to when I'm on the road filming. Expect behind the scenes at race weekends, driver features, super car test drives....and a bit of tech so you can channel your inner geek! 

2. SHIELDS DRIVES: 
As I mentioned, I drive a BMW i8 and because it's the time of year for giving, I thought I should share some of the enjoyment I get out of my car.. So, I have devised a cunning plan.... I'm starting a series called 'SHIELDS DRIVES' - I will be posting questions online about my i8. 

If YOU guess the RIGHT answer to a question about my i8, YOU could be the NEXT PASSENGER...

Welcome to ColourPop!
ColourPop was born, raised and made with love in the City of Angels (aka Los Angeles) so we can react quickly to the latest and greatest trends and get them in your fabulous hands stat.

We take the phrase “if you can dream it, you can do it” to a whole new level and specialize in making killer makeup in every shade imaginable at prices everyone can afford. We think that whole barrier between fancy and affordable is absolute nonsense. That’s why all of our products have luxury formulas at prices that won’t break the bank.

Have an idea for a great shade? Shoot us an email. We love feedback from our customers. We find inspiration everywhere from the catwalk to YouTube and can turn what’s trending now into a shade tomorrow.

PS. We are 100% fur baby friendly, bunny approved, and only test our products on humans – the ones in our HQ to be exact.

Everyone has a family. And every family has a story. ""This Is Us"" chronicles the Pearson family across the decades: from Jack (Milo Ventimiglia) and Rebecca (Mandy Moore) as young parents in the 1980s to their 37-year-old kids Kevin (Justin Hartley), Kate (Chrissy Metz) and Randall (Sterling K. Brown) searching for love and fulfillment in the present day. This grounded, life-affirming dramedy reveals how the tiniest events in our lives impact who we become, and how the connections we share with each other can transcend time, distance and even death. From the writer and directors of ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" comes a smart, modern show that will welcome you into a family you feel you've known for years.
